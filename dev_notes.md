# ab-line

+ When "free", no need to worry about sections numbers. Just create experiment plots, draw a line that goes through the middle of the plots. Then, machine and plot widths are enough to shift the middle line to the right place, which becomes the ab-line.
+ When "lock", you adjust the position of experiment plots, not ab-lines (obviously)
