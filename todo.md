+ [ ] measurement unit by input type (N, seed, )
+ [ ] trial design
  + [ ] sparse design
  + [ ] strip design
+ [ ] options of specifying sequences (within and across strips)
+ [ ] available form options in the website 
+ [ ] (deal with problem 1) check the overlap of rates
+ [ ] allow for specifying a complete sequence of rates within strip and across strips.
+ [ ] cut off ab-lines outside of the field boundary

# Problems

1. when field is not straight and plot widths are different, rates transitions do not align well
2. harvester ab-line for two-input case

# Vignette

+ ab-line options
  -  input: as-applied shape file, ab-line file, or angle
  -  lock, free, none 
+ trial design options
